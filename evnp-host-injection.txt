               draft-thubert-bess-evnp-Host-injection-00

Abstract

   This specification adds attributes to eVPN to carry IPv6 address
   metadata learned from RFC 8505 and RFC 8928 so as to maintain a
   synchronized copy of the 6LoWPAN ND registrar at each eVPN router and
   perform locally a unicast IPv6 ND service for address lookup and
   duplicate address detection.

1.  Introduction

   "Registration Extensions for IPv6 over 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery"
   [RFC8505] (ND) provides a routing-agnostic Host-to-Router Link-Local
   interface to claim an IPv6 address and obtain reachability services
   for that address.  [RFC8505] is already used to redistribute host
   routes in RPL [RFC9010] and RIFT "Routing in Fat Trees" [RIFT], and
   to maintain a proxy-ND state in a backbone router [RFC8929].

Internet-Draft             eVPN Unaware Hosts                  July 2021


   [RFC8505] specifies a unicast address registration mechanism that
   enables the host called a 6LowPAN Node (6LN) to install a ND binding
   state in the 6LowPAN Router (6LR) that can serve as Neighbor Cache
   Entry (NCE), though it is not operated as a cache.  The protocol
   provides the means to reject the registation in case of address
   duplication.  It also enables to discriminate mobility from
   multihoming.  [RFC8928] adds the capability to verify the ownership
   of the address and prevent an attacker from stealing and/or
   impersonating an address.

   [RFC8505] defines the 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) as an abstract
   address registrar that provides autoritative service for Address
   Registration and duplicate detection.  The 6LBR stores address
   metadata that is obtained during the Address Registration, including
   a owner ID and a sequence counter.  As part of the process of a new
   Address Registration, the 6LR queries the 6LBR for existing metadata
   related to the address being registered.  This enables in particular
   to detect a duplication and reject the registration.  This
   specification extends the 6LBR abstract data model to store the Link
   Layer Address (LLA) of the Registering Node.  This enables the 6LBR
   to perform locally, and using unicast communication, the IPv6 ND
   services of address lookup and duplicate address detection.

   The [RFC8505] address registrar can be centralized, but it can also
   be distributed and maintained synchronized using a routing protocol.
   This specification adds attributes to eVPN to carry the IPv6 address
   metadata learned from [RFC8505] so as to maintain a synchronized copy
   of the 6LBR abstract data at each eVPN router.

2.3.  References

   This document uses the terms Clos fabric and Fat Tree
   interchangeably, to refer to a folded spine-and-leaf topology as
   defined in the terminology section of "RIFT: Routing in Fat Trees"
   [RIFT].

   The term "leaf" represents the access switch that connects the
   servers to the Fat Tree.  The leaf is typically a Top-of-Rack (ToR)
   switch.

   This specification uses the terms 6LN, 6LR and 6LBR to refer
   specifically to nodes that implement the said roles in [RFC8505] and
   does not expect other functionality such as 6LoWPAN Header
   Compression:

   *  In the context of this document, the 6LN is a server that
      adversises an address mapping using [RFC8505], and optionally
      protects its ownership with [RFC8928].

   *  The 6LR and 6LBR function are collapsed at the leaf and its state
      is synchonized with that of the eVPN functional support using an
      internal interface that is out of scope.  That interface could be
      "pull" meaning that the 6LBR fetches the eVPN information when it
      needs it, or "push", meaning that any information that eVPn
      distributes is immediately fed in all the 6LBRs in all the leaves.
      Note that this is pure control plane and is not subject to
      abbreviating optimization as the FIB may be.

   In this document, readers will encounter terms and concepts that are
   discussed in the following documents:

3.  6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery

   This section goes through the 6LoWPAN ND mechanisms that this
   specification leverages, as a non-normative reference to the reader.
   The full normative text is to be found in [RFC6775], [RFC8505], and
   [RFC8928].

3.1.  RFC 6775 Address Registration

   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol" [RFC4861]
   [RFC4862] was defined for serial links and transit media such as
   Ethernet.  It is a reactive protocol that relies heavily on multicast
   operations for Address Discovery (aka Lookup) and Duplicate Address
   Detection (DAD).

   "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks" [RFC6775]
   adapts IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained LLNs.  The main
   functions of [RFC6775] are to proactively establish the Neighbor
   Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR and to prevent address duplication.  To
   that effect, [RFC6775] introduces a new unicast Address Registration
   mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast messages
   compared to the classical IPv6 ND protocol.

   [RFC6775] defines a new Address Registration Option (ARO) that is
   carried in the unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) messages between the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the
   6LoWPAN router (6LR).  It also defines the Duplicate Address Request
   (DAR) and Duplicate Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between the
   6LR and the 6LBR).  In an LLN, the 6LBR is the central repository of
   all the Registered Addresses in its domain and the source of truth
   for uniqueness and ownership.

3.2.  RFC 8505 Extended Address Registration

   "Registration Extensions for 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery" [RFC8505]
   updates RFC 6775 into a generic Address Registration mechanism that
   can be used to access services such as routing and ND proxy.  To that
   effect, [RFC8505] defines the Extended Address Registration Option
   (EARO), shown in Figure 1:


      0                   1                   2                   3

                        Figure 1: EARO Option Format

3.2.1.  R Flag

   [RFC8505] introduces the R Flag in the EARO.  The Registering Node
   sets the R Flag to indicate whether the 6LR should ensure
   reachability for the Registered Address.  If the R Flag is set to 0,
   then the Registering Node handles the reachability of the Registered
   Address by other means.  In an eVPN network, this means that either
   it is a RAN that injects the route by itself or that it uses another
   eVPN router for reachability services.

   This document specifies how the R Flag is used in the context of
   eVPN.  An eVPN Host that implements the 6LN functionality from
   [RFC8505] requires reachability services for an IPv6 address if and
   only if it sets the R Flag in the NS(EARO) used to register the
   address to a 6LR acting as an eVPN border router.  Upon receiving the
   NS(EARO), the eVPN router generates a BGP advertisement for the
   Registered Address if and only if the R flag is set to 1.


   [RFC9010] specifies that the 'R' flags is set in the responded NA
   messages if and only if the route was installed.  This specification
   echoes that behaviour.

3.2.2.  TID, "I" Field and Opaque Fields

   When the T Flag is set to 1, the EARO includes a sequence counter
   called Transaction ID (TID), that is needed to fill the Path Sequence
   Field in the eVPN Transit Option.  This is the reason why the support
   of [RFC8505] by the Host, as opposed to only [RFC6775], is a
   prerequisite for this specification); this requirement is fully
   explained in Section 4.1.  The EARO also transports an Opaque field
   and an associated "I" field that describes what the Opaque field
   transports and how to use it.

   This document specifies the use of the "I" field and the Opaque field
   by a Host.

3.2.3.  Status

   The values of the EARO status are maintained by IANA in the Address
   Registration Option Status Values subregistry [IANA-EARO-STATUS] of
   the Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters
   registry.

   [RFC6775] and [RFC8505] defines the original values whereas [RFC9010]
   reduced range to 64 values and reformated the octet field to enable
   to transport an external error, e.g., coming form a routing protocol.

   This specification uses the format expressed in [RFC9010].  The value
   of 0 denotes an unqualified success, 1 indicates an address
   duplication, 3 a TID value that is outdated, and 4 is used in an
   asynchronous NA to indicate that 6LN should remove that address and
   possibly form new ones.

3.2.4.  Route Ownership Verifier

   Section 5.3 of [RFC8505] introduces the Registration Ownership
   Verifier (ROVR) field of variable length from 64 to 256 bits.  The
   ROVR is a replacement of the EUI-64 in the ARO [RFC6775] that was
   used to identify uniquely an Address Registration with the Link-Layer
   address of the owner but provided no protection against spoofing.

   "Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy
   Networks" [RFC8928] leverages the ROVR field as a cryptographic proof
   of ownership to prevent a rogue third party from registering an
   address that is already owned.  The use of ROVR field enables the 6LR
   to block traffic that is not sourced at an owned address.

   This specification does not address how the protection by [RFC8928]
   could be extended for use in eVPN.  On the other hand, it adds the
   ROVR to the BGP advertisement to share the state with the other

   routers via the Reflector (see Section 5.1), which means that the
   routers that are aware of the Host route are also aware of the ROVR
   associated to the Target Address, whether it is cryptographic and
   should be verified.

3.3.  RFC 8505 Extended DAR/DAC

   [RFC8505] updates the DAR/DAC messages into the Extended DAR/DAC to
   carry the ROVR field.  The EDAR/EDAC exchange is not needed in this
   specification as the BGP fabric as a whole is synchronized to the
   same state via BGP and the reflector.  Based on its local state, the
   router can check whether the proposed route is new and legit, and
   reject it otherwise.

3.4.  RFC 7400 Capability Indication Option

   "6LoWPAN-GHC: Generic Header Compression for IPv6 over Low-Power
   Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)" [RFC7400] defines the
   6LoWPAN Capability Indication Option (6CIO) that enables a node to
   expose its capabilities in router Advertisement (RA) messages.

   [RFC8505] defines a number of bits in the 6CIO, in particular:

   L:  Node is a 6LR.
   E:  Node is an IPv6 ND Registrar -- i.e., it supports registrations
      based on EARO.
   P:  Node is a Routing Registrar, -- i.e., an IPv6 ND Registrar that
      also provides reachability services for the Registered Address.

       0                   1                   2                   3

                            Figure 2: 6CIO flags

   A 6LR that provides reachability services for a Host in an eVPN
   network as specified in this document includes a 6CIO in its RA
   messages and set the L, P and E flags to 1 as prescribed by
   [RFC8505].

3.5.  Extending 6LoWPAN ND

3.5.1.  Use of the R flag in NA

   This document extends [RFC8928] and [RFC8505] as follows

   This document also updates the behavior of a 6LR acting as eVPN
   router and of a 6LN acting as Host in the 6LoWPAN ND Address
   Registration as follows:

   *  The use of the R Flag is extended to the NA(EARO) to confirm
      whether the route was installed.

3.5.2.  Distributing the 6LBR

   This specification enables to distribute the 6LBR at the edge of the
   eVPN network and collapse the 6LBR function with that of the eVPN
   support.  In that model, the eVPN to 6LBR interaction becomes an
   internal interface, where each side informs the other in case of new
   information concerning an IP to Link-Layer Address (LLA) mapping.
   Since this is an internal interface, this specification makes no
   assumption on whether the 6LBR stores its own representation of the
   full eVPN state, which means that the eVPN support informs the 6LBR
   in case of any change on the eVPN side (this is called the push
   model, see Figure 9), or if the 6LBR queries the eVPN support when it
   does not have a mapping to satisfy a request (pull model, see
   Figure 8).

   This specification leverages [RFC8929] that augments the abstract
   data model of the 6LBR to store the LLA associated with the
   registered address.  Based on that additional state, the 6LBR in a
   leaf can communicate the mapping to the colocated eVPN function and
   respond to unicast address mapping lookups from the server side.

   In an environment where the server ranges from a classical host to a
   more complex platform that runs a collection of virtual hosts
   interconnected by a virtual switch, but where the host-to-leaf
   interface remains at layer 2, the 6LR and the 6LBR functions can be
   collapsed in the leaf.  The 6LR to 6LBR interaction also becomes an
   internal interface, and there is no need for EDAR/EDAC messages.

Internet-Draft             eVPN Unaware Hosts                  July 2021


   In that case, the MAC address associated to the Registered Address is
   indicated in the Target Link-Layer Address Option (TLLAO) in the NS
   message used for the registration, as shown in Figure 3.  In the case
   of a pull model, if the 6LBR does not have a local state for the
   mapping, it queries the eVPN support to obtain the eVPN state if any.
   If a mapping is known then the 6LR/6LBR evaluates the registration

   Else (this is for a new mapping), if the registration is accepted,
   then the 6LBR notifies the eVPN support to inject a route type 2 in
   the fabric.

3.5.3.  Unicast Address Lookup with the 6LBR

   A classical IPv6 ND stack in the server that treats the subnet prefix
   as on-link (more in section 4.6.2. of [RFC4861]), will resolve an
   unknown LLA mapping with a multicast NS(lookup) message addressed to
   the solicited note multicast address (SNMA) associated with the
   destination address being resolved.  The RECOMMENDED operation in
   that case is for the 6LBR that has a mapping state to forward the

   packet as a unicast MAC to the LLA that is stored for the IPv6
   address as expected by [RFC6085].  The actual owner of the address
   can then answer unicast with a NA message, setting the override (O)
   bit to 1, as shown in Figure 5.

                  Figure 5: Forwarding legacy NS (Lookup)

   Section 3.1. of [RFC8929] adds the capability to insert IPv6 ND
   options in the EDAR and EDAC messages.  This enables the 6LBR to
   store the link-layer address associated with the Registered Address
   and to serve as a mapping server.  [UNICAST-LOOKUP] leverages that
   state to define a new unicast address lookup operation, extending the
   EDAR and EDAC messages as the Address Mapping Request (AMR) and
   Confirmation (AMC) with a different Code Prefix [RFC8505].

   In that model, the router advertises the subnet prefix as not on-link
   by setting the L flag to 0 in the Prefix Information Option (PIO),
   more in section 4.6.2. of [RFC4861].  The expected behaviour is that
   the host that communicates with a peer in the same subnet refrains
   from resolving the address mapping and passes the packets directly to
   the router.

   In the case where the router is a virtual 6LR running in the server,
   and the source and destination are in the same subnet served by eVPN,
   the router then resolves the address mapping on behalf of the host.
   To that effect, the router sends a unicast AMR message to the 6LBR.
   The message contains the SLLAO of the router to which the 6LBR will
   reply.  If the binding is found, the 6LBR replies with an AMC message
   that contains the TLLOA with the requested MAC address, as shown in
   Figure 6.

   If it is not found, [UNICAST-LOOKUP] provides the capability to
   indicate immediately that the mapping is not known with a "not found"
   status in the AMC, as opposed to waiting for an NS(lookup) and
   retries to time out per [RFC4861].

   In a fully stateful subnet where all nodes register all their
   addresses with [RFC8505], this means that the looked up address is
   not present in the network; in that case the packet is dropped and an
   ICMP error type 1 "Destination Unreachable" code 3 "Address
   unreachable" [RFC4443] is returned as shown in Figure 7.

   Note that the figures above make no assumption on the pull vs. push
   model.  In the case of pull model, the 6LBR queries the eVPN support
   when it does not have the mapping information to satisfy a request.
   Figure 8 illustrates a successful pull model lookup flow, when the
   route type 2 for the mapping is already known on the eVPN side.

   In the case of push model, the eVPN support synchronizes its state
   upon a route type 2 with the 6LBR, and the 6LBR maintains an abstract
   data structure for all information known to eVPN.  This way, the 6LBR
   already has the mapping information to satisfy any request for an
   existing mapping and it can answer right away.  Figure 9 illustrates
   a successful push model lookup flow, when the 6LBR is already in
   possession of the mapping.

                            Figure 9: Push model

   In a mixed environment, a lookup failure (the mapping is not found
   though the address is present in the network) may be caused by a
   legacy node that was node discovered (aka a silent node).  In that
   case, it is an administrative decision for the 6LR to broadcast an
   NS(lookup) or to return an error as shown in Figure 7.

4.  Requirements on the eVPN-Unaware Host

   This document describes how eVPN routing can be extended to reach a
   Host.  This section specifies the minimal eVPN-independent
   functionality that the Host needs to implement to obtain routing
   services for its addresses.

4.1.  Support of 6LoWPAN ND

   A host sees a prefix as not on-link (e.g., it learned that prefix in
   a PIO in a RA with the L flag not set) should not attempt to resolve
   an address within that prefix using a multicast NS(lookup).  Instead,
   it must pass its packets to a router, preferably one that advertises
   that prefix in a PIO; it must register the address that it uses as
   source to that router to enable source address validation using
   [RFC8505].  It is recommended that the Host also implements [RFC8928]
   to prove its ownership of its addresses.

   The Host is expected to request routing services from a router only
   if that router originates RA messages with a 6CIO that has the L, P,
   and E flags all set to 1 as discussed in Section 3.4, unless
   configured to do so.  To obtain routing services for one of its
   addresses, the host must register the address to a router that
   advertises the prefix, setting the "R" and "T" flags in the EARO to 1
   as discussed in Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.2.2, respectively.

   This document echoes the behavior specified in [RFC9010] whereby,
   when the R Flag set to 1 in a NS(EARO) is not echoed in the NA(EARO),
   the host must understand that the route injection failed, and if the
   R flag is reset later in an asynchronous NA(EARO), the host must
   understand that routing service has failed.

   The host may attach to multiple 6LRs and is expected to prefer those
   that provide routing services.  The abstract model for this is a P2MP
   interface that wraps together as many P2P IP Links the host has
   adjacencies to 6LRs over that interface.  The IPv6 address and the
   subnet are associated to that interface.  The interface may be
   virtual and it may bundle multiple physical Ethernet interfaces that
   connect to the individual 6LRs over point to point wires, possibly
   via a software switch.  It can also be associated to one physical
   interface to an external switch, either way the PI Links can be
   assiciated to sub-interface of the interface.

   The Host needs to register to all the 6LRs from which it desires
   routing services.  The multiple Address Registrations to several 6LRs
   should be performed in a rapid sequence, using the same EARO for the
   same Address.  Gaps between the Address Registrations will invalidate
   some of the routes till the Address Registration finally shows on
   those routes.  The routers recognize the same (ROVR, TID) as the
   signal of a multihomed address and maintain all the routes.

   [RFC8505] introduces error Status values in the NA(EARO) which can be
   received synchronously upon an NS(EARO) or asynchronously.  The Host
   needs to support both cases and refrain from using the address when
   the Status value indicates a rejection.
