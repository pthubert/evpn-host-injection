Abstract

   This specification adds attributes to eVPN to carry IPv6 address
   metadata learned from RFC 8505 and RFC 8928 so as to maintain a
   synchronized copy of the 6LoWPAN ND registrar at each eVPN router and
   perform locally a unicast IPv6 ND service for address lookup and
   duplicate address detection.

1.  Introduction

   "Registration Extensions for IPv6 over 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery"
   [RFC8505] (ND) provides a routing-agnostic Host-to-Router Link-Local
   interface to claim an IPv6 address and obtain reachability services
   for that address.  [RFC8505] is already used to redistribute host
   routes in RPL [RFC9010] and RIFT "Routing in Fat Trees" [RIFT], and
   to maintain a proxy-ND state in a backbone router [RFC8929].

   [RFC8505] specifies a unicast address registration mechanism that
   enables the host called a 6LowPAN Node (6LN) to install a ND binding
   state in the 6LowPAN Router (6LR) that can serve as Neighbor Cache
   Entry (NCE), though it is not operated as a cache.  The protocol
   provides the means to reject the registation in case of address
   duplication.  It also enables to discriminate mobility from
   multihoming.  [RFC8928] adds the capability to verify the ownership
   of the address and prevent an attacker from stealing and/or
   impersonating an address.

   [RFC8505] defines the 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) as an abstract
   address registrar that provides autoritative service for Address
   Registration and duplicate detection.  The 6LBR stores address
   metadata that is obtained during the Address Registration, including
   a owner ID and a sequence counter.  As part of the process of a new
   Address Registration, the 6LR queries the 6LBR for existing metadata
   related to the address being registered.  This enables in particular
   to detect a duplication and reject the registration.  This
   specification extends the 6LBR abstract data model to store the Link
   Layer Address (LLA) of the Registering Node.  This enables the 6LBR
   to perform locally, and using unicast communication, the IPv6 ND
   services of address lookup and duplicate address detection.

   The [RFC8505] address registrar can be centralized, but it can also
   be distributed and maintained synchronized using a routing protocol.
   This specification adds attributes to eVPN to carry the IPv6 address
   metadata learned from [RFC8505] so as to maintain a synchronized copy
   of the 6LBR abstract data at each eVPN router.

2.3.  References

   This document uses the terms Clos fabric and Fat Tree
   interchangeably, to refer to a folded spine-and-leaf topology as
   defined in the terminology section of "RIFT: Routing in Fat Trees"
   [RIFT].

   The term "leaf" represents the access switch that connects the
   servers to the Fat Tree.  The leaf is typically a Top-of-Rack (ToR)
   switch.

   This specification uses the terms 6LN, 6LR and 6LBR to refer
   specifically to nodes that implement the said roles in [RFC8505] and
   does not expect other functionality such as 6LoWPAN Header
   Compression:

   *  In the context of this document, the 6LN is a server that
      adversises an address mapping using [RFC8505], and optionally
      protects its ownership with [RFC8928].

   *  The 6LR and 6LBR function are collapsed at the leaf and its state
      is synchonized with that of the eVPN functional support using an
      internal interface that is out of scope.  That interface could be
      "pull" meaning that the 6LBR fetches the eVPN information when it
      needs it, or "push", meaning that any information that eVPn
      distributes is immediately fed in all the 6LBRs in all the leaves.
      Note that this is pure control plane and is not subject to
      abbreviating optimization as the FIB may be.

   In this document, readers will encounter terms and concepts that are
   discussed in the following documents:

   eVPN:  "BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN" [RFC7432] and "Network
      Virtualization Overlay Solution" [RFC8365],

   Classical IPv6 ND:  "Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6" [RFC4861]
      and "IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration" [RFC4862],

   6LoWPAN ND:  Neighbor Discovery Optimization for Low-Power and Lossy
      Networks [RFC6775], "Registration Extensions for 6LoWPAN Neighbor
      Discovery" [RFC8505], "Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for
      Low-power and Lossy Networks" [RFC8928], and "IPv6 Backbone
      Router" [RFC8929].

3.  6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery

   This section goes through the 6LoWPAN ND mechanisms that this
   specification leverages, as a non-normative reference to the reader.
   The full normative text is to be found in [RFC6775], [RFC8505], and
   [RFC8928].

3.1.  RFC 6775 Address Registration

   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol" [RFC4861]
   [RFC4862] was defined for serial links and transit media such as
   Ethernet.  It is a reactive protocol that relies heavily on multicast
   operations for Address Discovery (aka Lookup) and Duplicate Address
   Detection (DAD).

   "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks" [RFC6775]
   adapts IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained LLNs.  The main
   functions of [RFC6775] are to proactively establish the Neighbor
   Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR and to prevent address duplication.  To
   that effect, [RFC6775] introduces a new unicast Address Registration
   mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast messages
   compared to the classical IPv6 ND protocol.

   [RFC6775] defines a new Address Registration Option (ARO) that is
   carried in the unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) messages between the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the
   6LoWPAN router (6LR).  It also defines the Duplicate Address Request
   (DAR) and Duplicate Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between the
   6LR and the 6LBR).  In an LLN, the 6LBR is the central repository of
   all the Registered Addresses in its domain and the source of truth
   for uniqueness and ownership.

3.2.  RFC 8505 Extended Address Registration

   "Registration Extensions for 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery" [RFC8505]
   updates RFC 6775 into a generic Address Registration mechanism that
   can be used to access services such as routing and ND proxy.  To that
   effect, [RFC8505] defines the Extended Address Registration Option
   (EARO), shown in Figure 1:

                        Figure 1: EARO Option Format

3.2.1.  R Flag

   [RFC8505] introduces the R Flag in the EARO.  The Registering Node
   sets the R Flag to indicate whether the 6LR should ensure
   reachability for the Registered Address.  If the R Flag is set to 0,
   then the Registering Node handles the reachability of the Registered
   Address by other means.  In an eVPN network, this means that either
   it is a RAN that injects the route by itself or that it uses another
   eVPN router for reachability services.

   This document specifies how the R Flag is used in the context of
   eVPN.  An eVPN Host that implements the 6LN functionality from
   [RFC8505] requires reachability services for an IPv6 address if and
   only if it sets the R Flag in the NS(EARO) used to register the
   address to a 6LR acting as an eVPN border router.  Upon receiving the
   NS(EARO), the eVPN router generates a BGP advertisement for the
   Registered Address if and only if the R flag is set to 1.


   [RFC9010] specifies that the 'R' flags is set in the responded NA
   messages if and only if the route was installed.  This specification
   echoes that behaviour.

3.2.2.  TID, "I" Field and Opaque Fields

   When the T Flag is set to 1, the EARO includes a sequence counter
   called Transaction ID (TID), that is needed to fill the Path Sequence
   Field in the eVPN Transit Option.  This is the reason why the support
   of [RFC8505] by the Host, as opposed to only [RFC6775], is a
   prerequisite for this specification); this requirement is fully
   explained in Section 4.1.  The EARO also transports an Opaque field
   and an associated "I" field that describes what the Opaque field
   transports and how to use it.

Internet-Draft             eVPN Unaware Hosts                  June 2021


   This document specifies the use of the "I" field and the Opaque field
   by a Host.

3.2.3.  Route Ownership Verifier

   Section 5.3 of [RFC8505] introduces the Registration Ownership
   Verifier (ROVR) field of variable length from 64 to 256 bits.  The
   ROVR is a replacement of the EUI-64 in the ARO [RFC6775] that was
   used to identify uniquely an Address Registration with the Link-Layer
   address of the owner but provided no protection against spoofing.

   "Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy
   Networks" [RFC8928] leverages the ROVR field as a cryptographic proof
   of ownership to prevent a rogue third party from registering an
   address that is already owned.  The use of ROVR field enables the 6LR
   to block traffic that is not sourced at an owned address.

   This specification does not address how the protection by [RFC8928]
   could be extended for use in eVPN.  On the other hand, it adds the
   ROVR to the BGP advertisement to share the state with the other
   routers via the Reflector (see Section 5.1), which means that the
   routers that are aware of the Host route are also aware of the ROVR
   associated to the Target Address, whether it is cryptographic and
   should be verified.

3.3.  RFC 8505 Extended DAR/DAC

   [RFC8505] updates the DAR/DAC messages into the Extended DAR/DAC to
   carry the ROVR field.  The EDAR/EDAC exchange is not needed in this
   specification as the BGP fabric as a whole is synchronized to the
   same state via BGP and the reflector.  Based on its local state, the
   router can check whether the proposed route is new and legit, and
   reject it otherwise.

3.4.  RFC 7400 Capability Indication Option

   "6LoWPAN-GHC: Generic Header Compression for IPv6 over Low-Power
   Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)" [RFC7400] defines the
   6LoWPAN Capability Indication Option (6CIO) that enables a node to
   expose its capabilities in router Advertisement (RA) messages.

   [RFC8505] defines a number of bits in the 6CIO, in particular:

   L:  Node is a 6LR.
   E:  Node is an IPv6 ND Registrar -- i.e., it supports registrations
      based on EARO.
   P:  Node is a Routing Registrar, -- i.e., an IPv6 ND Registrar that
      also provides reachability services for the Registered Address.

                            Figure 2: 6CIO flags

   A 6LR that provides reachability services for a Host in an eVPN
   network as specified in this document includes a 6CIO in its RA
   messages and set the L, P and E flags to 1 as prescribed by
   [RFC8505].

3.5.  Extending 6LoWPAN ND

3.5.1.  Distributing the 6LBR

   This specification enables to distribute the 6LBR at the edge of the
   eVPN network and collapse the 6LBR function with that of the eVPN
   support.  In that model, the eVPN to 6LBR interaction becomes an
   internal interface, where each side informs the other in case of new
   information concerning an IP to Link-Layer Address (LLA) mapping.
   Since this is an internal interface, this specification makes no
   assumption on whether the 6LBR stores its own representation of the
   eVPN state state, which means that the eVPN support informs the 6LBR
   in case of any change on the eVPN side (this is called the push
   model, see Figure 9), or if the 6LBR queries the eVPN support when it
   does not have a mapping to satisfy a request (pull model, see
   Figure 9).

   This specification augments the abstract data model of the 6LBR to
   store the LLA associated with the registered address.  Based on that
   additional state, the 6LBR can communicate the mapping to the
   colocated eVPN function.

   In an environment where the server is a classical host or hosts a
   collection of virtual hosts interconnected by a virtual switch, the
   6LR and the 6LBR functions are also collapsed in the leaf.  The 6LR
   to 6LBR interaction also becomes an internal interface, and there is
   no need for EDAR/EDAC messages.  In that case, the MAC address
   associated to the Registered Address is indicated in the Target Link-
   Layer Address Option (TLLAO) in the NS message used for the
   registration, as shown in Figure 3:

   In another type of deployment, the 6LR may be a virtual router in the
   server whereas the 6LBR runs in the leaf node.  To address that case,
   the EDAR/EDAC may be used to communicate as shown in figure 5 of
   [RFC8505].  This draft leverages the capability to insert IPv6 ND
   options in the EDAR and EDAC messages introduced in [RFC9010] to
   place a TLLAO that carries the MAC address associated to the
   Registered address in the EDAR and EDAC messages, as shown in
   Figure 4:

3.5.2.  Unicast Address Lookup with the 6LBR

   A classical IPv6 ND stack in the server that treats the subnet prefix
   as on-link (more in section 4.6.2. of [RFC4861]), will resolve an
   unknown LLA mapping with a multicast NS(lookup) message addressed to
   the solicited note multicast address (SNMA) associated with the
   destination address being resolved.  The RECOMMENDED operation in
   that case is for the 6LBR that has a mapping state to forward the
   packet as a unicast MAC to the LLA that is stored for the IPv6
   address as expected by [RFC6085].

                  Figure 6: Forwarding legacy NS (Lookup)

   Section 3.1. of [RFC8929] adds the capability to insert IPv6 ND
   options in the EDAR and EDAC messages.  This enables the 6LBR to
   store the link-layer address associated with the Registered Address
   and to serve as a mapping server as described in [UNICAST-LOOKUP].
   The draft extends the EDAR and EDAR messages for address lookup with
   the same ICMPv6 types but with a different Code Prefix [RFC8505].

   In that model, the router advertises the subnet prefix as not on-link
   by setting the L flag to 0 in the Prefix Information Option (PIO)
   (more in section 4.6.2. of [RFC4861].  The expected behaviour is that
   the host that communicates with a peer in the same subnet refrains
   from resolving the address mapping and passes the packets directly to
   the router.  Figure 7 illustrates the case where the router is a
   virtual 6LR running in the server, in which case is can resolve the
   address of the destination with a unicast lookup to the 6LBR.

               Figure 7: Unicast Lookup from the virtual Host

   [UNICAST-LOOKUP] provides the capability to indicate that the mapping
   is not known.  In a fully stateful subnet where all nodes register
   their address with [RFC8505], this means that the address is not
   present in the network, in which case the packet is dropped and an
   ICMP error type 1 "Destination Unreachable" code 3 "Address
   unreachable" [RFC4443] is returned as shown in Figure 8.

   Note that the figures above make no assumption on the pull vs. push
   model.  In the case of pull model, the 6LBR queries the eVPN support
   when it does not have the mapping information to satisfy a request.
   Figure 9 illustrates a successful pull model lookup flow, when the
   route type 2 for the mapping was effectively received from the eVPN
   side.

                           Figure 9: Pull models

   In the case of push model, the eVPN support synchronizes its state
   upon a route type 2 with the 6LBR, and the 6LBR maintains an abstract
   data structure for all information known to eVPN.  This way, the 6LBR
   already has the mapping information to satisfy any request for an
   existing mapping and it can answer right away.  Figure 10 illustrates
   a successful push model lookup flow, when the route type 2 for the
   mapping was effectively received from the eVPN side.

                           Figure 10: Push model

   In a mixed environment, a lookup miss may be caused by a legacy node
   that was node discovered (aka a silent node).  In that case, it is an
   administrative decision for the 6LR to broadcast an NS(lookup) or to
   return an error as shown in Figure 8.

Internet-Draft             eVPN Unaware Hosts                  June 2021


4.  Requirements on the eVPN-Unaware Host

   This document describes how eVPN routing can be extended to reach a
   Host.  This section specifies the minimal eVPN-independent
   functionality that the Host needs to implement to obtain routing
   services for its addresses.

4.1.  Support of 6LoWPAN ND

   To obtain routing services from a router that implements this
   specification, a Host needs to implement [RFC8505] and sets the "R"
   and "T" flags in the EARO to 1 as discussed in Section 3.2.1 and
   Section 3.2.2, respectively.  This document specifies new behaviors
   for the Host, e.g., when the R Flag set to 1 in a NS(EARO) is not
   echoed in the NA(EARO), which indicates that the route injection
   failed.

   The Host is expected to request routing services from a router only
   if that router originates RA messages with a 6CIO that has the L, P,
   and E flags all set to 1 as discussed in Section 3.4, unless
   configured to do so.  It is suggested that the Host also implements
   [RFC8928] to protect the ownership of its addresses.

   A Host that may attach to multiple 6LRs is expected to prefer those
   that provide routing services.  The Host needs to register to all the
   6LRs from which it desires routing services.

   Parallel Address Registrations to several 6LRs should be performed in
   a rapid sequence, using the same EARO for the same Address.  Gaps
   between the Address Registrations will invalidate some of the routes
   till the Address Registration finally shows on those routes.

   [RFC8505] introduces error Status values in the NA(EARO) which can be
   received synchronously upon an NS(EARO) or asynchronously.  The Host
   needs to support both cases and refrain from using the address when
   the Status value indicates a rejection.

5.  Enhancements to eVPN

   This document specifies a new behavior whereby a 6LR injects BGP
   advertisements for unicast addresses (see Section 7) on behalf of
   Hosts that are not aware of eVPN.  This document also synchronizes
   the liveness monitoring at the Address Registration period.

6.  Enhancements to RFC8928 and RFC8505

   This document extends [RFC8928] and [RFC8505] as follows

   This document also updates the behavior of a 6LR acting as eVPN
   router and of a 6LN acting as Host in the 6LoWPAN ND Address
   Registration as follows:

   *  The use of the R Flag is extended to the NA(EARO) to confirm
      whether the route was installed.
