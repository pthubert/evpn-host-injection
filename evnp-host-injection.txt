Abstract

   This specification adds attributes to eVPN to carry IPv6 address
   metadata learned from RFC 8505 and RFC 8928 so as to maintain a
   synchronized copy of the 6LoWPAN ND registrar at each eVPN router and
   perform locally a unicast IPv6 ND service for address lookup and
   duplicate address detection.

1.  Introduction

   "Registration Extensions for IPv6 over 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery"
   [RFC8505] (ND) provides a routing-agnostic Host-to-Router Link-Local
   interface to claim an IPv6 address and obtain reachability services
   for that address.  [RFC8505] is already used to redistribute host
   routes in RPL [RFC9010] and RIFT "Routing in Fat Trees" [RIFT], and
   to maintain a proxy-ND state in a backbone router [RFC8929].

   [RFC8505] specifies a unicast address registration mechanism that
   enables the host called a 6LowPAN Node (6LN) to install a ND binding
   state in the 6LowPAN Router (6LR) that can serve as Neighbor Cache
   Entry (NCE), though it is not operated as a cache.  The protocol
   provides the means to reject the registation in case of address
   duplication.  It also enables to discriminate mobility from

   multihoming.  [RFC8928] adds the capability to verify the ownership
   of the address and prevent an attacker from stealing and/or
   impersonating an address.

   [RFC8505] defines the 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) as an abstract
   address registrar that provides autoritative service for Address
   Registration and duplicate detection.  The 6LBR stores address
   metadata that is obtained during the Address Registration, including
   a owner ID and a sequence counter.  As part of the process of a new
   Address Registration, the 6LR queries the 6LBR for existing metadata
   related to the address being registered.  This enables in particular
   to detect a duplication and reject the registration.  This
   specification extends the 6LBR abstract data model to store the Link
   Layer Address (LLA) of the Registering Node.  This enables the 6LBR
   to perform locally, and using unicast communication, the IPv6 ND
   services of address lookup and duplicate address detection.

   The [RFC8505] address registrar can be centralized, but it can also
   be distributed and maintained synchronized using a routing protocol.
   This specification adds attributes to eVPN to carry the IPv6 address
   metadata learned from [RFC8505] so as to maintain a synchronized copy
   of the 6LBR abstract data at each eVPN router.

2.3.  References

   This document uses the terms Clos fabric and Fat Tree
   interchangeably, to refer to a folded spine-and-leaf topology as
   defined in the terminology section of "RIFT: Routing in Fat Trees"
   [RIFT].

   The term "leaf" represents the access switch that connects the
   servers to the Fat Tree.  The leaf is typically a Top-of-Rack (ToR)
   switch.

   This specification uses the terms 6LN, 6LR and 6LBR to refer
   specifically to nodes that implement the said roles in [RFC8505] and
   does not expect other functionality such as 6LoWPAN Header
   Compression:

   *  In the context of this document, the 6LN is a server that
      adversises an address mapping using [RFC8505], and optionally
      protects its ownership with [RFC8928].

   *  The 6LR and 6LBR function are collapsed at the leaf and its state
      is synchonized with that of the eVPN functional support using an
      internal interface that is out of scope.  That interface could be
      "pull" meaning that the 6LBR fetches the eVPN information when it
      needs it, or "push", meaning that any information that eVPn
      distributes is immediately fed in all the 6LBRs in all the leaves.
      Note that this is pure control plane and is not subject to
      abbreviating optimization as the FIB may be.

   In this document, readers will encounter terms and concepts that are
   discussed in the following documents:

      Virtualization Overlay Solution" [RFC8365],

      Low-power and Lossy Networks" [RFC8928], and "IPv6 Backbone
      Router" [RFC8929].

3.  6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery

   6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery defines a stateful address
   autoconfiguration mechanism for IPv6. 6LoWPAN ND enables to divorce
   the L3 abstractions for link and subnet from the characteristics of
   the L2 link and broadcast domain.  It is applicable beyond its
   original field of IoT to any environment where the broadcast nature
   of the underlaying network should not be exploited, e.g., in the case
   of a wireless link where broadcast uses an excessive amount of
   spectrum, and a distributed cloud, where it may span too widely.

   In contrast to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862]
   which relies on broadcast for duplicate address detection (DAD) and
   address lookup, 6LoWPAN ND installs and maintains a state in the
   neighbors for the duration of their interaction.  Though it is also
   called a Neighbor Cache Entry (BCE) in [RFC6775], and in contrast
   with the the BCE in SLAAC, that state is not a cache that can be
   casually flushed and rebuilt.  It must be installed proactively and
   refreshed periodically to maintain the connecticity and enable
   unicast-only operations.

   The typical abstraction for an IP Link with 6LoWPAN ND is point-to-
   point (P2P) between a node and a router.  An IP interface bundles
   multiple links between this node and peers in the same subnet, aka
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP).  The subnet is a not-on-link L3-connected
   collection of such nodes and links, which means that the any-to-any
   connectivity across the subnet is ensured through L3 routing as
   opposed to transitive (any-to-any) reachability from L2.

   This section goes through the 6LoWPAN ND mechanisms that this
   specification leverages, as a non-normative reference to the reader.
   The relevant normative text is to be found in [RFC6775], [RFC8505],
   and [RFC8928].

3.1.  RFC 6775 Address Registration

   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol" [RFC4861]
   [RFC4862] was defined for serial links and transit media such as
   Ethernet.  It is a reactive protocol that relies heavily on multicast
   operations for Address Discovery (aka Lookup) and Duplicate Address
   Detection (DAD).

   "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks" [RFC6775]
   adapts IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained LLNs.  The main
   functions of [RFC6775] are to proactively establish the Neighbor
   Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR and to prevent address duplication.  To
   that effect, [RFC6775] introduces a new unicast Address Registration
   mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast messages
   compared to the classical IPv6 ND protocol.

   [RFC6775] defines a new Address Registration Option (ARO) that is
   carried in the unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) messages between the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the
   6LoWPAN router (6LR).  It also defines the Duplicate Address Request
   (DAR) and Duplicate Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between the
   6LR and the 6LBR.  In an LLN, the 6LBR is the central repository of
   all the Registered Addresses in its domain and the source of truth
   for uniqueness and ownership.

3.2.  RFC 8505 Extended Address Registration

   "Registration Extensions for 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery" [RFC8505]
   updates RFC 6775 into a generic Address Registration mechanism that
   can be used to access services such as routing and ND proxy.  To that
   effect, [RFC8505] defines the Extended Address Registration Option
   (EARO), shown in Figure 1:


      0                   1                   2                   3

3.2.1.  R Flag

   [RFC8505] introduces the R Flag in the EARO.  The Registering Node
   sets the R Flag to indicate whether the 6LR should ensure
   reachability for the Registered Address.  If the R Flag is set to 0,
   then the Registering Node handles the reachability of the Registered
   Address by other means.  In an eVPN network, this means that either
   it is a RAN that injects the route by itself or that it uses another
   eVPN router for reachability services.

   This document specifies how the R Flag is used in the context of
   eVPN.  An eVPN Host that implements the 6LN functionality from
   [RFC8505] requires reachability services for an IPv6 address if and
   only if it sets the R Flag in the NS(EARO) used to register the
   address to a 6LR acting as an eVPN border router.  Upon receiving the
   NS(EARO), the eVPN router generates a BGP advertisement for the
   Registered Address if and only if the R flag is set to 1.


   [RFC9010] specifies that the 'R' flags is set in the responded NA
   messages if and only if the route was installed.  This specification
   echoes that behaviour.

3.2.2.  TID, "I" Field and Opaque Fields

   When the T Flag is set to 1, the EARO includes a sequence counter
   called Transaction ID (TID), that is needed to format the MAC
   Mobility Extended Community.  This is the reason why the support of
   [RFC8505] by the Host, as opposed to only [RFC6775], is a
   prerequisite for this specification); this requirement is fully
   explained in Section 5.1.  The EARO also transports an Opaque field
   and an associated "I" field that describes what the Opaque field
   transports and how to use it.

   This document specifies the use of the "I" field and the Opaque field
   by a Host.

3.2.3.  Status

   The values of the EARO status are maintained by IANA in the Address
   Registration Option Status Values subregistry [IANA-EARO-STATUS] of
   the Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters
   registry.

   [RFC6775] and [RFC8505] defined the original values whereas [RFC9010]
   reduced range to 64 values and reformated the octet field to enable
   to transport an external error, e.g., coming form a routing protocol.

Internet-Draft             eVPN Unaware Hosts                  July 2021


   This specification uses the format expressed in [RFC9010].  The value
   of 0 denotes an unqualified success, 1 indicates an address
   duplication, 3 a TID value that is outdated, and 4 is used in an
   asynchronous NA to indicate that 6LN should remove that address and
   possibly form new ones.

3.2.4.  Route Ownership Verifier

   Section 5.3 of [RFC8505] introduces the Registration Ownership
   Verifier (ROVR) field of variable length from 64 to 256 bits.  The
   ROVR is a replacement of the EUI-64 in the ARO [RFC6775] that was
   used to identify uniquely an Address Registration with the Link-Layer
   address of the owner but provided no protection against spoofing.

   "Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy
   Networks" [RFC8928] leverages the ROVR field as a cryptographic proof
   of ownership to prevent a rogue third party from registering an
   address that is already owned.  The use of ROVR field enables the 6LR
   to block traffic that is not sourced at an owned address.

   This specification does not address how the protection by [RFC8928]
   could be extended for use in eVPN.  On the other hand, it adds the
   ROVR to the BGP advertisement to share the state with the other
   routers via the Reflector (see Section 6.1), which means that the
   routers that are aware of the Host route are also aware of the ROVR
   associated to the Target Address, whether it is cryptographic and
   should be verified.

3.3.  RFC 8505 Extended DAR/DAC

   [RFC8505] updates the DAR/DAC messages to EDAR/EDAC messages to carry
   the ROVR field.  The EDAR/EDAC exchange takes place between the 6LR
   to which the node registers an address, and the abstract 6LBR that
   stores the reference value for the ROVR and the TID associated to
   that address.  It is triggered by an NS(EARO) message from a 6LN to
   the 6LR, to create, refresh, compare and delete the corresponding
   state in the 6LBR.

   In the status returned with the EDAC message, the 6LBR indicates if
   the registration is accepted, should be challenged, or is duplicate.
   The status of 0 (success) indicates that the address is either new or
   that the current registration matches, and in particular that the
   ROVR at the 6LBR and the one in the EDAR message are identical.

                          Figure 2: EDAR/EDAC flow

   The EDAR/EDAC exchange is protected by the retry mechanism specified
   in Section 8.2.6 of [RFC6775], though in a data center, a duration
   significantly shorter than the default value of the RetransTimer
   [RFC4861] of 1 second may be sufficient to cover the round-trip delay
   between the 6LR and the 6LBR.

   With this specification, the 6LBR is distributed across the leaves,
   and all the leaves where an address is currently registered maintain
   a full 6LBR state for the address, aka local state in the following
   text.  The specification leverages the EDAR/EDAC exchange to ensure
   that a leaf (acting as a 6LR) that needs to create a 6LBR state for a
   new registration has the same value for the ROVR as any 6LBR already
   serving that address on another leaf.  At the same time, the
   specification avoids placing full ROVR information in BGP so 1) it is
   not observable by a potential attacker and 2) the new attributes
   remain reasonably small.

3.4.  RFC 7400 Capability Indication Option

   "6LoWPAN-GHC: Generic Header Compression for IPv6 over Low-Power
   Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)" [RFC7400] defines the
   6LoWPAN Capability Indication Option (6CIO) that enables a node to
   expose its capabilities in router Advertisement (RA) messages.

   [RFC8505] defines a number of bits in the 6CIO, in particular:

   L:  Node is a 6LR.
   E:  Node is an IPv6 ND Registrar -- i.e., it supports registrations

      also provides reachability services for the Registered Address.

                            Figure 3: 6CIO flags

   A 6LR that provides reachability services for a Host in an eVPN
   network as specified in this document includes a 6CIO in its RA
   messages and set the L, P and E flags to 1 as prescribed by
   [RFC8505].

4.  Extending 6LoWPAN ND

4.1.  Use of the R flag in NA

   This document extends [RFC8928] and [RFC8505] as follows

   This document also updates the behavior of a 6LR acting as eVPN
   router and of a 6LN acting as Host in the 6LoWPAN ND Address
   Registration as follows:

   *  The use of the R Flag is extended to the NA(EARO) to confirm
      whether the route was installed.

4.2.  Distributing the 6LBR

   This specification enables to distribute the 6LBR at the edge of the
   eVPN network and collapse the 6LBR function with that of the eVPN
   support.  In that model, the eVPN to 6LBR interaction becomes an
   internal interface, where each side informs the other in case of new
   information concerning an IP to Link-Layer Address (LLA) mapping.
   Since this is an internal interface, this specification makes no
   assumption on whether the 6LBR stores its own representation of the
   full eVPN state, which means that the eVPN support informs the 6LBR
   in case of any change on the eVPN side (this is called the push
   model, see Figure 10), or if the 6LBR queries the eVPN support when
   it does not have a mapping to satisfy a request (pull model, see
   Figure 9).

   This specification leverages [RFC8929] that augments the abstract
   data model of the 6LBR to store the LLA associated with the
   registered address.  Based on that additional state, the 6LBR in a
   leaf can communicate the mapping to the colocated eVPN function and
   respond to unicast address mapping lookups from the server side.

   In an environment where the server ranges from a classical host to a
   more complex platform that runs a collection of virtual hosts
   interconnected by a virtual switch, but where the host-to-leaf
   interface remains at layer 2, the 6LR and the 6LBR functions can be
   collapsed in the leaf.  The 6LR to 6LBR interaction also becomes an
   internal interface, and there is no need for EDAR/EDAC messages.

   In that case, the MAC address associated to the Registered Address is
   indicated in the Target Link-Layer Address Option (TLLAO) in the NS
   message used for the registration, as shown in Figure 4.  In the case
   of a pull model, if the 6LBR does not have a local state for the
   mapping, it queries the eVPN support to obtain the eVPN state if any.
   If a mapping is known then the 6LR/6LBR evaluates the registration
   for address duplication and other possible issues per [RFC8505].
   Else (this is for a new mapping), if the registration is accepted,
   then the 6LBR notifies the eVPN support to inject a route type 2 in
   the fabric.

   In another type of deployment, the 6LR may be a virtual router in the
   server whereas the 6LBR runs in the leaf node.  To address that case,
   the EDAR/EDAC may be used to communicate as shown in figure 5 of
   [RFC8505].  This draft leverages the capability to insert IPv6 ND
   options in the EDAR and EDAC messages introduced in [RFC8929] to

                         Figure 5: leveraging EDAR

   [RFC8505] updates the DAR/DAC messages into the Extended DAR/DAC to
   carry the ROVR field.  With this specification, the abstract 6LBR is
   distributed in all the Leaf nodes and synchronized with eVPN.  When a
   server successfully registers an address to a leaf, the 6LR on that
   leaf becomes 6LBR for that address.  It stores the full state for
   that address including the ROVR and the TID.  When the address
   registration moves to another leaf, an EDAR/EDAC flow between the 6LR
   in the new leaf and the 6LBR in the old leaf confirms that the ROVR
   in the NS(EARO) received at the new leaf is correct, in which case
   the 6LR in the new leaf becomes 6LBR.

   When the address is already registered to the local leaf, the EDAR/
   EDAC exchange is either local between a virtual router in the server
   and the leaf, or internal to the leaf between a collapsed 6LR and

   6LBR.  Based on its local state, the 6LBR in the leaf checks whether
   the proposed address/route is new and legit, and can reject it
   otherwise.

   It results that duplicate addresses and address impersonation attacks
   can be filtered at the level of IPv6 ND by the 6LBR before the
   information reaches eVPN.

4.3.  Unicast Address Lookup with the 6LBR

   A classical IPv6 ND stack in the server that treats the subnet prefix
   as on-link (more in section 4.6.2. of [RFC4861]), will resolve an
   unknown LLA mapping with a multicast NS(lookup) message addressed to
   the solicited node multicast address (SNMA) associated with the
   destination address being resolved.  The RECOMMENDED operation in
   that case is for the 6LBR that has a mapping state to forward the
   packet as a unicast MAC to the LLA that is stored for the IPv6
   address as expected by [RFC6085].  The actual owner of the address
   can then answer unicast with a NA message, setting the override (O)
   bit to 1, as shown in Figure 6.

   Section 3.1. of [RFC8929] adds the capability to insert IPv6 ND
   options in the EDAR and EDAC messages.  This enables the 6LBR to
   store the link-layer address associated with the Registered Address
   and to serve as a mapping server.  [UNICAST-LOOKUP] leverages that
   state to define a new unicast address lookup operation, extending the
   EDAR and EDAC messages as the Address Mapping Request (AMR) and
   Confirmation (AMC) with a different Code Prefix [RFC8505].

   In that model, the router advertises the subnet prefix as not on-link
   by setting the L flag to 0 in the Prefix Information Option (PIO),
   more in section 4.6.2. of [RFC4861].  The expected behaviour is that
   the host that communicates with a peer in the same subnet refrains
   from resolving the address mapping and passes the packets directly to
   the router.

   In the case where the router is a virtual 6LR running in the server,
   and the source and destination are in the same subnet served by eVPN,
   the router then resolves the address mapping on behalf of the host.
   To that effect, the router sends a unicast AMR message to the 6LBR.
   The message contains the SLLAO of the router to which the 6LBR will
   reply.  If the binding is found, the 6LBR replies with an AMC message
   that contains the TLLOA with the requested MAC address, as shown in
   Figure 7.

   If it is not found, [UNICAST-LOOKUP] provides the capability to
   indicate immediately that the mapping is not known with a "not found"
   status in the AMC, as opposed to waiting for an NS(lookup) and
   retries to time out per [RFC4861].

   In a fully stateful subnet where all nodes register all their
   addresses with [RFC8505], this means that the looked up address is
   not present in the network; in that case the packet is dropped and an
   ICMP error type 1 "Destination Unreachable" code 3 "Address
   unreachable" [RFC4443] is returned as shown in Figure 8.

   In the case of push model, the eVPN support synchronizes its state
   upon a route type 2 with the 6LBR, and the 6LBR maintains an abstract
   data structure for all information known to eVPN.  This way, the 6LBR
   already has the mapping information to satisfy any request for an
   existing mapping and it can answer right away.  Figure 10 illustrates
   a successful push model lookup flow, when the 6LBR is already in
   possession of the mapping.

   In a mixed environment, a lookup failure (the mapping is not found
   though the address is present in the network) may be caused by a
   legacy node that was node discovered (aka a silent node).  In that
   case, it is an administrative decision for the 6LR to broadcast an
   NS(lookup) or to return an error as shown in Figure 8.

5.  Requirements on the eVPN-Unaware Host

   This document describes how eVPN routing can be extended to reach a
   Host.  This section specifies the minimal eVPN-independent
   functionality that the Host needs to implement to obtain routing
   services for its addresses.

5.1.  Support of 6LoWPAN ND

   A host sees a prefix as not on-link (e.g., it learned that prefix in
   a PIO in a RA with the L flag not set) should not attempt to resolve
   an address within that prefix using a multicast NS(lookup).  Instead,
   it must pass its packets to a router, preferably one that advertises
   that prefix in a PIO; it must register the address that it uses as
   source to that router to enable source address validation using
   [RFC8505].  It is recommended that the Host also implements [RFC8928]
   to prove its ownership of its addresses.

   The Host is expected to request routing services from a router only
   if that router originates RA messages with a 6CIO that has the L, P,
   and E flags all set to 1 as discussed in Section 3.4, unless
   configured to do so.  To obtain routing services for one of its
   addresses, the host must register the address to a router that
   advertises the prefix, setting the "R" and "T" flags in the EARO to 1
   as discussed in Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.2.2, respectively.

   This document echoes the behavior specified in [RFC9010] whereby,
   when the R Flag set to 1 in a NS(EARO) is not echoed in the NA(EARO),
   the host must understand that the route injection failed, and if the
   R flag is reset later in an asynchronous NA(EARO), the host must
   understand that routing service has failed.

   The host may attach to multiple 6LRs and is expected to prefer those
   that provide routing services.  The abstract model for this is a P2MP
   interface that wraps together as many P2P IP Links the host has
   adjacencies to 6LRs over that interface.  The IPv6 address and the
   subnet are associated to that interface.  The interface may be
   virtual and it may bundle multiple physical Ethernet interfaces that
   connect to the individual 6LRs over point to point wires, possibly
   via a software switch.  It can also be associated to one physical
   interface to an external switch, either way the PI Links can be
   associated to sub-interface of the interface.

   The Host needs to register to all the 6LRs from which it desires
   routing services.  The multiple Address Registrations to several 6LRs
   should be performed in a rapid sequence, using the same EARO for the
   same Address.  Gaps between the Address Registrations will invalidate
   some of the routes till the Address Registration finally shows on

Internet-Draft             eVPN Unaware Hosts                  July 2021


   those routes.  The routers recognize the same (ROVR, TID) as the
   signal of a multihomed address and maintain all the routes.  In the
   case of eVPN, the Ethernet Segment must also be the same.  The flow
   for a successful multihomed registrtaion is illustrated in Figure 13.

   [RFC8505] introduces error Status values in the NA(EARO) which can be
   received synchronously upon an NS(EARO) or asynchronously.  The Host
   needs to support both cases and refrain from using the address when
   the Status value indicates a rejection.

6.  Enhancements to eVPN

   This section addresses the necessary changes to EVPN formats and
   behavior to support address registration security per [RFC8928] and
   mobility per [RFC8505] while retaining interoperability with
   traditional nodes.  With 6LR injecting not only MACs via packet
   sources and TLLAO options but also ROVR into mobility extended
   community their semantics will be somewhat extended.  Specifically
   following issues have to be addressed:

   *  The ROVR extends the semantics of the type-2 MAC advertisement via
      changes in MAC Mobility Extended Community in the sense that the
      MAC must be aligned with the ROVR and under normal circumstances
      only the validity of ROVR guarantees that the type-2 MAC can be
      allocated to the requester.  A MAC validated by ROVR should take
      precedence over MAC addresses allocated without using it given it
      presents a much more trustworthy topological information (it will
      be called ROVR MAC in further text).  EVPN nodes not supporting
      extensions introduced by this document will need to be led to
      believe that a ROVR MAC is to be preferred over any advertisement
      they see as long a ROVR MAC is present.  Nevertheless, primary key
      of NRLI is still the MAC address as defined in [RFC7432],
      Section 7.2 and 7.7.  This implies that the same MAC (and
      consequently ROVR MAC) can be assigned multiple IP addresses and
      those represent independent NLRIs.

   *  The TID field in the EARO is smaller than the mobility sequence
      number in [RFC7432].  To allow a ROVR MAC mobility to "win" over
      legacy MACs, signalling must be introduced that enables to
      distinguish a TID-generated sequence number from a legacy sequence
      number.

   *  [RFC8505] supports IP multihoming, but does not differentiate
      multihoming from anycast, e.g., using the MAC address, to enable
      MAC address rotation.  If an anycast IP address is registered with
      a different ROVR it will be rejected as duplicate.  If it is
      registered with a different TI, the older sequence will be
      withdrawn.  So the basic expectation with [RFC8505] is that the



Thubert & Przygienda     Expires 8 January 2022                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft             eVPN Unaware Hosts                  July 2021


      advertisement of an anycast address is coordinated, with the same
      keypair known to all parties, and the same value of the TID used
      by all nodes (and possibly never increasing), in other words, with
      no concept of mobility.  This specification adds a flag in eVPN
      that signals that the IP address is anycast and requires the local
      6LBR to ignore the duplication if the same IP address is
      registered locally, and then to inject the NLRI with the flag set
      as well.

   *  [RFC8928] needs the full ROVR to validate the address ownership,
      but the full ROVR can be too large to advertise through BGP.  When
      an IP address is advertised through eVPN, it is REQUIRED that the
      eVPN Next Hop is the address of the 6LBR of the leaf where the
      address was registered.  This way, if the address is registered
      later on a second leaf, the 6LR in second leaf can leverage an
      out-of-band EDAR/EDAC exchange with that 6LBR to validate that the
      ROVR in the registration is indeed the same.  When that is the
      case, it can continue with the registration procedure and if
      successful, become a 6LBR for that IP address, either as a
      mobility event or as a multihomed registration.

   *  [RFC8928] expects nodes to autoconfigure the keypair that is used
      to form the ROVR, in which case the IPv6 address can be locally
      autoconfigured with no central coordination; in that case, the
      ROVR only protects the ownership and enforce first-come first-
      serve and source address validation.  But is is also possible to
      pre-provision the ROVR in the 6LBR and then provision the keypair
      in the node, e.g., in the case of a trusted server.  To enable
      that capability in eVPN, this specification adds a flag to signal
      that the 6LBR that injects the address in eVPN does not provide
      reachability to the address.  When that flag is set, the value of
      the TID is ignored in the mobility computation, the mapping to the
      MAC address is ignored, and the route to the IP address is not
      injected in the RIB.

   EVPN Signalling is not used to carry ROVR since without challenge per
   [RFC8928] they do not represent any difference over using the IP/MAC
   combination.  Instead, the full ROVR is verified upon a movement or a
   multihomed advertismeent using an EDAR/EDAC exchange.  Additionally,
   backwards compatibility could not be preserved given comparing routes
   based on ROVR would present a change in primary key of NLRIs which
   non-ROVR routes could not follow.  An indication from a ROVR node
   that a MAC has been validated by proof of ownership is enough to
   convey the necessary information.  Only a small hash of the ROVR is
   carried to speed up the identification of an address duplication.

6.1.  ROVR MAC Mobility Extended Community

   Extending MAC Mobility Extended Community allows to design a solution
   that, while backwards compatible, allows to introduce ROVR MAC as
   "more trusted" entities.  Figure 11 presents the according extensions
   that will however necessitate some further explanation.

   To introduce a "precedence" of ROVR MACs over normal EVPN MACs ROVR
   MACs are advertised to look like "sticky" MACs for non-ROVR nodes.
   As defined in the glossary, for simplicity reasons such nodes will be
   called non-ROVR nodes vs. ROVR nodes.  The "sticky" bit will force
   non-ROVR nodes to disregard the sequence number and accept any NLRI
   route provided.

   ROVR nodes MUST set the "R" flag in Mobility Extended Community to
   indicate that the advertisement is a ROVR MAC in case the host
   followed the according procedures.  ROVR MACs use (instead of
   increasing the normal sequence number) the TID in the high bits of
   the sequence number field to "override" any normal MAC advertisement
   (further considerations will be provided in Section 6.2).

   ROVR nodes MUST set the "V" flag if the address assignment passed
   proof of ownership per [RFC8928].  Such addresses will be preferred
   by ROVR nodes over non validated ROVR MACs.

   In case a ROVR node configures the address as "sticky" (since the
   sticky bit semantics have been changed to the point a ROVR cannot
   tell whether address is really sticky unless advertised as such by
   non-ROVR node) a new "X" flag called "super sticky" is introduced.

      that eVPN next hop, but is advertised for the purpose of
      protecting the value of the ROVR at all times.

   A:  Anycast, indicating that the IP address duplication should be
      ignored.

   S:  Sticky as defined in [RFC7432].

   R:  ROVR Capable indicates that the advertisement is originated after
      processing signalling from host meeting the requirements in
      Section 5.  This indicates a ROVR MAC.

   V:  ROVR Validated indicates that the MAC passed proof of ownership
      per [RFC8928].  Presence of this bit implies the "R" bit being set
      irregardless of its value.

   X:  Super Sticky indicates that the ROVR MAC is sticky and should
      follow procedures of sticky per [RFC7432].

   Sequence Number Field:

   TID:  contains the ROVR MAC TID per [RFC8505].  This MUST NOT be
      zero, i.e. a ROVR

   ROVR Hash:  Hash of ROVR used to generate the according ROVR MAC.
      Hash is built by XOR'ing ROVR bytes in network order into the
      least significant byte and rotating the three bytes after every
      byte by one bit to the left.

6.2.  Extended ROVR MAC Procedures

   In case a non-ROVR node advertises a sticky MAC by setting the "S"
   bit and a ROVR node sees an ROVR address registration for the same
   MAC it MUST follow procedures per [RFC7432].

   In case a non-ROVR node advertises a sequence number larger than the
   one generated by TID on a ROVR node, the ROVR node SHOULD advertise a
   Sequence Number consisting of all bits being set to force a "roll-
   over" on all nodes and then fall back to advertising the TID
   generated sequence number again.  In case a non-ROVR node persists in
   increasing the sequence number after that it is indication of
   violation of [RFC7432] on its part.

   A ROVR node advertising a ROVR MAC that has not been validated and
   receiving same type-2 NLRI that has been validated MUST immediately
   withdraw its advertisement.

   A ROVR node advertising a ROVR MAC and receiving an equivalent ROVR
   MAC from other node with a higher TID MUST immediately withdraw its
   advertisement.  This will allow the non-ROVR nodes to correctly
   interpret the sequence as MAC move despite ignoring the sequence
   number due to presence of "S" bit.

   A ROVR node that receives a ROVR MAC with "super sticky" indication
   and seeing the MAC locally MUST follow analogous procedures to
   [RFC7432].

   Multi-homing a MAC on mix of ROVR and non-ROVR nodes will lead to
   operational notifications since per [RFC7432] the non-ROVR node will
   interpret the situation as a sticky MAC that has shown up on its
   local interface unless an implementation is somewhat clever and
   understands that the presence of the same ESI on all the routes
   indicates that this situation does not represent a sticky MAC being
   moved.

7.  Protocol Operations
