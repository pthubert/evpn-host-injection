  This specification adds attributes to eVPN to carry host-related information
  learned from RFC 8505 and RFC 8928 so as to maintain a synchronized copy of
  the 6LoWPAN ND registrar at each eVPN router and perform a local unicast
  IPv6 ND service for address lookup and duplicate address detection.

<t>
  <xref target='RFC8505'>"Registration Extensions for IPv6 over 6LoWPAN
  Neighbor Discovery"</xref> (ND) provides a routing-agnostic Host-to-Router
  Link-Local interface to claim an IPv6 address and obtain reachability services
  for that address. <xref target='RFC8505'/> is already used to redistribute
  host routes in RPL <xref target='RFC9010'/> and RIFT
  <xref target='I-D.ietf-rift-rift'>"Routing in Fat Trees"</xref>, and to
  maintain a proxy-ND state in a backbone router <xref target='RFC8929'/>.
</t>
<t>
  The interface provides the means to reject claims for duplicate addresses and
  discriminate mobility from multihoming. <xref target='RFC8928'/> adds the
  capability to verify the ownership of the address and prevent an attacker
  from stealing and/or impersonating an address. <xref target='RFC8505'/>
  is based on an abstract registrar, the 6LoWPAN Border router (6LBR),
  that stores host-related information.
</t>
<t>
  This specification adds attributes to eVPN to cary host-related information
  learned from <xref target='RFC8505'/> and <xref target='RFC8928'/> so as to
  maintain a synchronized copy of the 6LBR abstract data at each eVPN router.
  It also extends the 6LBR abstract data model to store the Link Layer Address
  of the Registering Node and perform locally, and using unicast communication,
  the IPv6 ND services of address lookup and duplicate address detection.

This document uses the terms Clos fabric and Fat Tree interchangeably, to
refer to a folded spine-and-leaf topology as defined in the terminology section
of <xref target='I-D.ietf-rift-rift'>"RIFT: Routing in Fat Trees"</xref>.
</t>
<t>
The term "leaf" represents the access switch that connects the servers to the
Fat Tree. The leaf is typically a Top-of-Rack (ToR) switch.
</t>
<t>
This specification uses the terms 6LN, 6LR and 6LBR to refer specifically to
nodes that implement the said roles in <xref target='RFC8505'/> and does not
expect other functionality such as 6LoWPAN Header Compression:
</t>

<ul>
   <li>
   In the context of this document, the 6LN is a server that adversises an
   address mapping using <xref target='RFC8505'/>, and optionally protects its
   ownership with <xref target='RFC8928'/>.
   </li><li>
   The 6LR and 6LBR function are collapsed at the leaf and its state is
   synchonized with that of the eVPN functional support using an internal
   interface that is out of scope. That interface could be "pull" meaning that
   the 6LBR fetches the eVPN information when it needs it, or "push", meaning
   that any information that eVPn distributes is immediately fed in all the
   6LBRs in all the leaves. Note that this is pure control plane and is not
   subject to abbreviating optimization as the FIB may be.

This section goes through the 6LoWPAN ND mechanisms that this specification leverages, as a non-normative reference to the reader.

<t>
   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol"
   <xref target='RFC4861'/> <xref target='RFC4862'/> was defined for serial
   links and transit media such as Ethernet. It is a reactive protocol that
   relies heavily on multicast operations for Address Discovery (aka Lookup) and
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).
</t><t>
   <xref target='RFC6775'>
   "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks"</xref>
   adapts IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained LLNs.
   The main functions of <xref target='RFC6775'/> are to proactively establish
   the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR and to prevent address duplication.
   To that effect, <xref target='RFC6775'/> introduces a new unicast Address
   Registration  mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast
   messages compared to the classical IPv6 ND protocol.

</t><t><xref target='RFC6775'/> defines a new Address
   Registration Option (ARO) that is carried in the unicast
   Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages between
   the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the 6LoWPAN router (6LR).

   It also defines the Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate
   Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between the 6LR and the 6LBR).
   In an LLN, the 6LBR is the central repository of all the Registered Addresses
   in its domain and the source of truth for uniqueness and ownership.

<section anchor='R8505ER'><name>R Flag</name>
<t>
<xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the R Flag in the EARO.
   The Registering Node sets the R Flag to indicate whether the 6LR should
   ensure reachability for the Registered Address.
   If the R Flag is set to 0, then the Registering Node handles the reachability
   of the Registered Address by other means. In an eVPN network, this means that
   either it is a RAN that injects the route by itself or that it uses another
   eVPN router for reachability services.
</t><t>
   This document specifies how the R Flag is used in the context of eVPN.
   An eVPN Host that implements the 6LN functionality from <xref target='RFC8505'/>
   requires reachability services for an IPv6 address if and only if it sets
   the R Flag in the NS(EARO) used to register the address to a 6LR acting as
   an eVPN border router. Upon receiving the NS(EARO), the eVPN router
   generates a BGP advertisement for the Registered Address if and only if the R
   flag is set to 1.
</t><t>
</t><t>

   <xref target='RFC9010'/> specifies that the 'R' flags is
   set in the responded NA messages if and only if the route was installed.
   This specification echoes that behaviour.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "R Flag" -->
<section anchor='R8505ETID'><name>TID, "I" Field and Opaque Fields</name>

<t>
   When the T Flag is set to 1, the EARO includes a sequence counter called
   Transaction ID (TID), that is needed to fill the Path Sequence Field in the
   eVPN Transit Option.
   This is the reason why the support of <xref target='RFC8505'/>
   by the Host, as opposed to only <xref target='RFC6775'/>, is a prerequisite for
   this specification); this requirement is fully explained in
   <xref target='prereq6lp'/>. The EARO also
   transports an Opaque field and an associated "I" field that describes what
   the Opaque field transports and how to use it.
</t><t>
   This document specifies the use of the "I" field and the Opaque
   field by a Host.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "TID, I Field and Opaque Fields" -->
<section anchor='R8505EROVR'><name>Route Ownership Verifier</name>
<t>
   Section 5.3 of <xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the Registration
   Ownership Verifier (ROVR) field of variable length from 64 to 256 bits.
   The ROVR is a replacement of the EUI-64 in the ARO
   <xref target='RFC6775'/> that was used to identify uniquely an Address
   Registration with the Link-Layer address of the owner but provided no
   protection against spoofing.
</t><t>

   <xref target='RFC8928'>"Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks"</xref> leverages the ROVR field as a
   cryptographic proof of ownership to prevent a rogue third party from
   registering an address that is already owned.
   The use of ROVR field enables the 6LR to block traffic that is not
   sourced at an owned address.
</t><t>

   This specification does not address how the protection by
   <xref target='RFC8928'/> could be extended for use in eVPN.
   On the other hand, it adds the ROVR to the BGP advertisement to share the
   state with the other routers via the Reflector (see <xref target='tgt'/>),
   which means that the routers that are aware of the Host route are also aware
   of the ROVR associated to the Target Address, whether it is cryptographic
   and should be verified.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "ROVR" -->

</section> <!-- end section "RFC 8505 Extended ARO" -->
<section anchor='R8505D'><name>RFC 8505 Extended DAR/DAC</name>
<t>
   <xref target='RFC8505'/> updates the DAR/DAC messages into the Extended
   DAR/DAC to carry the ROVR field. The EDAR/EDAC exchange is not needed in this
   specification as the BGP fabric as a whole is synchronized to the same state
   via BGP and the reflector. Based on its local state, the router can check
   whether the proposed route is new and legit, and reject it otherwise.

<section anchor='prereq'><name>Requirements on the eVPN-Unaware Host</name>
<t>
   This document describes how eVPN routing can be extended to reach a Host.
   This section specifies the minimal eVPN-independent functionality that the Host
   needs to implement to obtain routing services for its addresses.
</t>

 <section anchor='prereq6lp'><name>Support of 6LoWPAN ND</name>
<t>
   To obtain routing services from a router that implements this specification,
   a Host needs to implement <xref target='RFC8505'/> and sets the "R" and "T"
   flags in the EARO to 1 as discussed in <xref target='R8505ER'/> and
   <xref target='R8505ETID'/>, respectively. This document specifies new
   behaviors for the Host, e.g., when the R Flag set to 1 in a NS(EARO) is not
   echoed in the NA(EARO), which indicates that the route injection failed.
</t><t>
   The Host is expected to request routing services from a router only if that
   router originates RA messages with a 6CIO that has the L, P, and E flags all
   set to 1 as discussed in <xref target='R7400'/>, unless configured to do so.
   It is suggested that the Host also implements
   <xref target='RFC8928'/> to protect the ownership of its addresses.
</t><t>
   A Host that may attach to multiple 6LRs is expected to prefer those that provide routing services.
   The Host needs to register to all the 6LRs from which it desires routing services.
</t>
<t>
   Parallel Address Registrations to several 6LRs should be performed in a rapid sequence, using the same EARO for the same Address. Gaps between
   the Address Registrations will invalidate some of the routes till the Address
   Registration finally shows on those routes.
</t>
<t><xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces error Status values in the NA(EARO)
   which can be received synchronously upon an NS(EARO) or asynchronously. The
   Host needs to support both cases and refrain from using the address
   when the Status value indicates a rejection.
