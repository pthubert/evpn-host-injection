  This specification adds attributes to EVPN to carry IPv6 address metadata
  learned from RFC 8505 and RFC 8928 so as to maintain a synchronized copy of
  the 6LoWPAN ND registrar at each EVPN router and perform locally a unicast
  IPv6 ND service for address lookup and duplicate address detection.

<section anchor='introduction'><name>Introduction</name>


<t>
  <xref target='RFC8505'>"Registration Extensions for IPv6 over 6LoWPAN
  Neighbor Discovery"</xref> (ND) provides a zeroconf routing-agnostic
  Host-to-Router Link-Local interface for Stateful Address Autoconfiguration.
  <xref target='RFC8928'>"Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-Power and
  Lossy Networks"</xref> (AP-ND) adds a zeroconf anti-theft protection that protects the ownership of the autoconfigured address with autoconfigured proof of ownership called a Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR).
</t>
<t>
  <xref target='RFC8505'/> enables the host to claim an IPv6 address and obtain
  reachability services for that address. It is already used to inject host
  routes in RPL <xref target='RFC9010'/> and RIFT
  <xref target='I-D.ietf-rift-rift'>"Routing in Fat Trees"</xref>, and to
  maintain a proxy-ND state in a backbone router <xref target='RFC8929'/>; this
  specification extends its applicability to the case of Ethernet Virtual
  Private Network (eVPN).
</t>

<t>
  <xref target="RFC8505"/> specifies a unicast address registration mechanism
  that enables the host called a 6LowPAN Node (6LN) to install a ND binding
  state in the 6LowPAN Router (6LR) that can serve as Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE),
  though it is not operated as a cache.
  The protocol provides the means to reject the registration in case of address
  duplication. It also enables to discriminate mobility from multihoming.
  <xref target='RFC8928'/> adds the capability to verify the ownership of the
  address and prevent an attacker from stealing and/or impersonating an address.
</t>

<t>
  <xref target="RFC8505"/> defines the 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) as an
  abstract address registrar that provides authoritative service for Address
  Registration and duplicate detection. The 6LBR stores address metadata
  that is obtained during the Address Registration, including an owner ID and a
  sequence counter.
  As part of the process of a new Address Registration, the 6LR queries the 6LBR
  for existing metadata related to the address being registered. This enables in
  particular to detect a duplication and reject the registration.
  This specification extends the 6LBR abstract data model to store the
  Link Layer Address (LLA) of the Registering Node. This enables the 6LBR to
  perform locally, and using unicast communication, the IPv6 ND services of
  address lookup and duplicate address detection.
</t>

<t>
  The <xref target='RFC8505'/> address registrar can be centralized, but it can
  also be distributed and maintained synchronized using a routing protocol.
  This specification adds attributes to EVPN to carry the IPv6 address metadata
  learned from <xref target='RFC8505'/> so as to maintain a synchronized copy of
  the 6LBR abstract data at each EVPN router.

This document uses the terms Clos fabric and Fat Tree interchangeably, to
refer to a folded spine-and-leaf topology as defined in the terminology section
of <xref target='I-D.ietf-rift-rift'>"RIFT: Routing in Fat Trees"</xref>.
</t>
<t>
The term "leaf" represents the access switch that connects the servers to the
Fat Tree. The leaf is typically a Top-of-Rack (ToR) switch.
</t>
<t>
This specification uses the terms 6LN, 6LR and 6LBR to refer specifically to
nodes that implement the said roles in <xref target='RFC8505'/> and does not
expect other functionality such as 6LoWPAN Header Compression:
</t>

<ul>
   <li>
   In the context of this document, the 6LN is a server that advertises an
   address mapping using <xref target='RFC8505'/>, and optionally protects its
   ownership with <xref target='RFC8928'/>.
   </li><li>
   The 6LR and 6LBR function are collapsed at the leaf and its state is
   synchronized with that of the EVPN functional support using an internal
   interface that is out of scope. That interface could be "pull" meaning that
   the 6LBR fetches the EVPN information when it needs it, or "push", meaning
   that any information that EVPN distributes is immediately fed in all the
   6LBRs in all the leaves. Note that this is pure control plane and is not
   subject to abbreviating optimization as the FIB may be.

<section anchor='lpnd'><name>6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery</name>
<t>
  6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery defines a stateful address autoconfiguration
  mechanism for IPv6. 6LoWPAN ND enables to divorce the L3 abstractions for
  link and subnet from the characteristics of the L2 link and broadcast domain.
  It is applicable beyond its original field of IoT to any environment where
  the broadcast nature of the underlaying network should not be exploited, e.g.,
  in the case of a wireless link where broadcast uses an excessive amount of
  spectrum, and a distributed cloud, where it may span too widely.
</t>
<t>
  In contrast to Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target=
  'RFC4862'/> which relies on broadcast for duplicate address detection (DAD)
  and address lookup, 6LoWPAN ND installs and maintains a state in the
  neighbors for the duration of their interaction. Though it is also called a
  Neighbor Cache Entry (BCE) in <xref target='RFC6775'/>, and in contrast with
  the the BCE in SLAAC, that state is not a cache that can be casually flushed and rebuilt. It must be installed proactively  and refreshed periodically to
  maintain the connectivity and enable unicast-only operations.
</t>
<t>
  The typical abstraction for an IP Link with 6LoWPAN ND is point-to-point (P2P)
  between a node and a router. An IP interface bundles multiple links between
  this node and peers in the same subnet, aka point-to-multipoint (P2MP). The
  subnet is a not-on-link L3-connected collection of such nodes and links, which
  means that the any-to-any connectivity across the subnet is ensured through L3
  routing as opposed to transitive (any-to-any) reachability from L2.
</t>
<t>
  This section goes through the 6LoWPAN ND mechanisms that this specification
  leverages, as a non-normative reference to the reader. The relevant normative
  text is to be found in <xref target='RFC6775'/>, <xref target='RFC8505'/>, and
  <xref target='RFC8928'/>.

<section anchor='R6775'><name>RFC 6775 Address Registration</name>

<t>
   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol"
   <xref target='RFC4861'/> <xref target='RFC4862'/> was defined for serial
   links and transit media such as Ethernet. It is a reactive protocol that
   relies heavily on multicast operations for Address Discovery (aka Lookup) and
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).
</t><t>
   <xref target='RFC6775'>
   "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks"</xref>
   adapts IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained LLNs.
   The main functions of <xref target='RFC6775'/> are to proactively establish
   the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR and to prevent address duplication.
   To that effect, <xref target='RFC6775'/> introduces a new unicast Address
   Registration  mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast
   messages compared to the classical IPv6 ND protocol.

</t><t><xref target='RFC6775'/> defines a new Address
   Registration Option (ARO) that is carried in the unicast
   Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages between
   the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the 6LoWPAN router (6LR).
   It also defines the Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate
   Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between the 6LR and the 6LBR.
   In a Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN), the 6LBR is the central repository of
   all the Registered Addresses in its domain and the authoritative source of
   truth for uniqueness and ownership.

<section anchor='R8505ER'><name>R Flag</name>
<t>
<xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the R Flag in the EARO.
   The Registering Node sets the R Flag to indicate whether the 6LR should
   ensure reachability for the Registered Address.
   If the R Flag is set to 0, then the Registering Node handles the reachability
   of the Registered Address by other means. In an EVPN network, this means that
   either it is a RAN that injects the route by itself or that it uses another
   EVPN router for reachability services.
</t><t>
   This document specifies how the R Flag is used in the context of EVPN.
   An EVPN Host that implements the 6LN functionality from <xref target='RFC8505'/>
   requires reachability services for an IPv6 address if and only if it sets
   the R Flag in the NS(EARO) used to register the address to a 6LR acting as
   an EVPN border router. Upon receiving the NS(EARO), the EVPN router
   generates a BGP advertisement for the Registered Address if and only if the R
   flag is set to 1.
</t><t>
</t><t>

   <xref target='RFC9010'/> specifies that the 'R' flags is
   set in the responded NA messages if and only if the route was installed.
   This specification echoes that behavior.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "R Flag" -->
<section anchor='R8505ETID'><name>TID, "I" Field and Opaque Fields</name>

<t>
   When the T Flag is set to 1, the EARO includes a sequence counter called
   Transaction ID (TID), that is needed to format the MAC Mobility Extended Community.
   This is the reason why the support of <xref target='RFC8505'/>
   by the Host, as opposed to only <xref target='RFC6775'/>, is a prerequisite for
   this specification); this requirement is fully explained in
   <xref target='prereq6lp'/>. The EARO also
   transports an Opaque field and an associated "I" field that describes what
   the Opaque field transports and how to use it.
</t><t>
   This document specifies the use of the "I" field and the Opaque
   field by a Host.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "TID, I Field and Opaque Fields" -->
<section anchor='R8505stat'><name>Status</name>

<t>
   The values of the EARO status are maintained by IANA in the
   Address Registration Option Status Values subregistry
   <xref target="IANA-EARO-STATUS"/> of the
   Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters registry.
</t>
<t>
  <xref target='RFC6775'/> and <xref target='RFC8505'/> defined the original
  values whereas <xref target='RFC9010'/> reduced range to 64 values and
  reformatted the octet field to enable to transport an external error, e.g.,
  coming form a routing protocol.
</t>
<t>
  This specification uses the  format expressed in <xref target='RFC9010'/>.
  The value of 0 denotes an unqualified success, 1 indicates an address
  duplication, 3 a TID value that is outdated, and 4 is used in an asynchronous
  NA to indicate that 6LN should remove that address and possibly form new ones.
</t>
</section> <!-- end section "Status" -->
<section anchor='R8505EROVR'><name>Route Ownership Verifier</name>
<t>
   Section 5.3 of <xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the Registration
   Ownership Verifier (ROVR) field of variable length from 64 to 256 bits.
   The ROVR is a replacement of the EUI-64 in the ARO
   <xref target='RFC6775'/> that was used to identify uniquely an Address
   Registration with the Link-Layer address of the owner but provided no
   protection against spoofing.
</t><t>

   <xref target='RFC8928'>"Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks"</xref> leverages the ROVR field as a
   cryptographic proof of ownership to prevent a rogue third party from
   registering an address that is already owned.
   The use of ROVR field enables the 6LR to block traffic that is not
   sourced at an owned address.
</t><t>

   This specification does not address how the protection by
   <xref target='RFC8928'/> could be extended for use in EVPN.
   On the other hand, it adds the ROVR to the BGP advertisement to share the
   state with the other routers via the Reflector (see <xref target='tgt'/>),
   which means that the routers that are aware of the Host route are also aware
   of the ROVR associated to the Target Address, whether it is cryptographic
   and should be verified.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "ROVR" -->

</section> <!-- end section "RFC 8505 Extended ARO" -->
<section anchor='R8505D'><name>RFC 8505 Extended DAR/DAC</name>

<t>
   <xref target='RFC8505'/> updates the DAR/DAC messages to EDAR/EDAC messages
   to carry  the ROVR field. The EDAR/EDAC exchange takes place between the 6LR
   to which the node registers an address, and the abstract 6LBR that stores the
   reference value for the ROVR and the TID associated to that address.
   It is triggered by an NS(EARO) message from a 6LN to the 6LR, to create,
   refresh, compare and delete the corresponding state in the 6LBR.
</t>
<t>
   In the status returned with the EDAC message, the 6LBR indicates if the
   registration is accepted, should be challenged, or is duplicate. The status
   of 0 (success) indicates that the address is either new or that the current
   registration matches, and in particular that the ROVR at the 6LBR and the
   one in the EDAR message  are identical.

   The EDAR/EDAC
   exchange is protected by the retry mechanism specified in Section 8.2.6 of
   <xref target='RFC6775'/>, though in a data center, a duration significantly
   shorter than the default value of the Retransmission Timer <xref target=
   'RFC4861'/> of 1 second may be sufficient to cover the round-trip delay
   between the 6R and the 6LBR.
</t>
<t>
   With this specification, the 6LBR is distributed across the leaves, and all
   the leaves where an address is currently registered maintain a full 6LBR
   state for the address, aka local state in the following text.  The
   specification leverages the EDAR/EDAC exchange to ensure
   that a leaf (acting as a 6LR) that needs to create a 6LBR state for a new
   registration has the same value for the ROVR as any 6LBR already serving that
   address on another leaf. At the same time, the specification avoids placing
   full ROVR information in BGP so 1) it is not observable by a potential
   attacker and 2) the new attributes remain reasonably small.

<section anchor='dist'><name>Distributing the 6LBR</name>


   <t>
	This specification enables to distribute the 6LBR at the edge of the EVPN
    network and collapse the 6LBR function with that of the EVPN support.
    In that model, the EVPN to 6LBR interaction becomes an internal interface,
    where each side informs the other in case of new information concerning an
    IP to Link-Layer Address (LLA) mapping. Since this is an internal interface,
    this specification makes no assumption on whether the 6LBR stores its own
    representation of the full EVPN state, which means that the EVPN support
    informs the 6LBR in case of any change on the EVPN side (this is called
    the push model, see <xref target="Figpush"/>), or if the 6LBR queries the
    EVPN support when it does not have a mapping to satisfy a request (pull
    model, see <xref target="Figpull"/>).
   </t>
   <t>
    This specification leverages <xref target='RFC8929'/> that augments the
    abstract data model of the 6LBR to store the LLA associated with the
    registered address. Based on that additional state, the 6LBR in a leaf can
    communicate the mapping to the colocated EVPN function and respond to
    unicast address mapping lookups from the server side.
   </t>
   <t>
    In an environment where the server ranges from a classical host to a more
    complex platform that runs a collection of virtual hosts interconnected by
    a virtual switch, but where the host-to-leaf interface remains at layer 2,
    the 6LR and the 6LBR functions can be collapsed in the  leaf.
    The 6LR to 6LBR interaction also becomes an internal interface, and
    there is no need for EDAR/EDAC messages.
   </t>
   <t>
    In that case, the MAC address associated to the Registered Address is
    indicated in the Target Link-Layer Address Option (TLLAO) in the NS message
    used for the registration, as shown in <xref target="Figdir"/>.
    In the case of a pull model, if the 6LBR does not have a local state for
    the mapping, it queries the EVPN support to obtain the EVPN state if any.
    If a mapping is known then the 6LR/6LBR evaluates the registration for
    address duplication and other possible issues per <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
    Else (this is for a new mapping), if the registration is accepted, then
    the 6LBR notifies the EVPN support to inject a route type 2 in the fabric.

   <xref target='RFC8505'/> updates the DAR/DAC messages into the Extended
   DAR/DAC to carry the ROVR field. With this specification, the abstract 6LBR
   is distributed in all the Leaf nodes and synchronized with EVPN.
   When a server successfully registers an address to a leaf, the 6LR on that
   leaf becomes 6LBR for that address. It stores the full state for that address
   including the ROVR and the TID. When the address registration moves to
   another leaf, an EDAR/EDAC flow between the 6LR in the new leaf and the 6LBR
   in the old leaf confirms that the ROVR in the NS(EARO) received at the new
   leaf is correct, in which case the 6LR in the new leaf becomes 6LBR.
</t>
<t>
   When the address is already registered to the local leaf,
   the EDAR/EDAC exchange is either local between a virtual router in the server
   and the leaf, or internal to the leaf between a collapsed 6LR and 6LBR.
   Based on its local state, the 6LBR in the leaf checks whether the proposed
   address/route is new and legit, and can reject it otherwise.
</t>
<t>
   It results that
   duplicate addresses and address impersonation attacks can be filtered at the
   level of IPv6 ND by the 6LBR before the information reaches EVPN.

<t>
  A classical IPv6 ND stack in the server that treats the subnet prefix as
  on-link (more in section 4.6.2. of <xref target="RFC4861" format="default"
  sectionFormat="of"/>), will resolve an unknown LLA mapping with a multicast
  NS(lookup) message addressed to the solicited node multicast address (SNMA)
  associated with the destination address being resolved. The RECOMMENDED
  operation in that case is for the 6LBR that has a mapping state to forward the
  packet as a unicast MAC to the LLA that is stored for the IPv6 address as
  expected by  <xref target="RFC6085"/>. The actual owner of the address can
  then answer unicast with a NA message, setting the override (O) bit to 1,
  as shown in <xref target="figlkup1"/>.

  Section 3.1. of <xref target="RFC8929" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
  adds the capability to insert IPv6 ND options in the EDAR and EDAC messages.
  This enables the 6LBR to store the link-layer address associated with the
  Registered Address and to serve as a mapping server.
  <xref target="I-D.thubert-6lo-unicast-lookup"/> leverages that state to define
  a new unicast address lookup operation, extending the EDAR and EDAC
  messages as the Address Mapping Request (AMR) and Confirmation (AMC) with a
  different Code Prefix <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
  </t>
  <t>
  In that model, the router advertises the subnet prefix as not on-link by
  setting the L flag to 0 in the Prefix Information Option (PIO), more in
  section 4.6.2. of <xref target="RFC4861" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
  The expected behavior is that the host that communicates with a peer in the
  same subnet refrains from resolving the address mapping and passes the packets
  directly to the router.
  </t>
  <t>In the case where the router is a virtual 6LR running in the server, and
  the source and destination are in the same subnet served by EVPN, the router
  then resolves the address mapping on behalf of the host. To that effect,
  the router sends a unicast AMR message to the 6LBR.
  The message contains the SLLAO of the router to which the 6LBR will reply.
  If the binding is found, the 6LBR replies with an AMC message that contains
  the TLLOA with the requested MAC address, as shown in <xref target="unilook1"/>.

  In the case of push model, the EVPN support synchronizes its state upon a route type 2 with the 6LBR, and the 6LBR maintains an abstract data structure for all information known to EVPN. This way, the 6LBR already has the mapping information to satisfy any request for an existing mapping and

  In a mixed environment, a lookup failure (the mapping is not found though
  the address is present in the network) may be caused by a legacy node that
  was node discovered (aka a silent node).
  In that case, it is an administrative decision for the 6LR to broadcast an
  NS(lookup) or to return an error as shown in <xref target="unilookfail"/>.

<section anchor='prereq'><name>Requirements on the EVPN-Unaware Host</name>
<t>
   This document describes how EVPN routing can be extended to reach a Host.
   This section specifies the minimal EVPN-independent functionality that the Host
   needs to implement to obtain routing services for its addresses.
</t>

 <section anchor='prereq6lp'><name>Support of 6LoWPAN ND</name>
<t>
   A host sees a prefix as not on-link (e.g., it learned that prefix in a PIO
   in a RA with the L flag not set) should not attempt to resolve an address
   within that prefix using a multicast NS(lookup).
   Instead, it must pass its packets to a router, preferably one that advertises
   that prefix in a PIO; it must register the address that it uses as source to
   that router to enable source address validation using
   <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
   It is recommended that the Host also implements <xref target='RFC8928'/> to
   prove its ownership of its addresses.
</t><t>
   The Host is expected to request routing services from a router only if that
   router originates RA messages with a 6CIO that has the L, P, and E flags all
   set to 1 as discussed in <xref target='R7400'/>, unless configured to do so.
   To obtain routing services for one of its addresses, the host must register
   the address to a router that advertises the prefix, setting the "R" and "T"
   flags in the EARO to 1 as discussed in <xref target='R8505ER'/> and
   <xref target='R8505ETID'/>, respectively.
</t><t>
   This document echoes the behavior specified in <xref target='RFC9010'/>
   whereby, when the R Flag set to 1 in a NS(EARO) is not echoed in the NA(EARO),
   the host must understand that the route injection failed, and
   if the R flag is reset later in an asynchronous NA(EARO), the host must
   understand that routing service has failed.
</t><t>
   The host may attach to multiple 6LRs and is expected to prefer those that
   provide routing services. The abstract model for this is a P2MP interface
   that wraps together as many P2P IP Links the host has adjacencies to 6LRs
   over that interface. The IPv6 address and the subnet are associated to that
   interface.
   The interface may be virtual and it may bundle multiple physical Ethernet
   interfaces that connect to the individual 6LRs over point to point wires,
   possibly via a software switch.
   It can also be associated to one physical interface to an external switch,
   either way the PI Links can be associated to sub-interface of the interface.

</t>
<t>
   The Host needs to register to all the 6LRs from which it desires routing
   services. The multiple Address Registrations to several 6LRs should be
   performed in a rapid sequence, using the same EARO for the same Address.
   Gaps between the Address Registrations will invalidate some of the routes
   till the Address Registration finally shows on those routes.
   The routers recognize the same (ROVR, TID) as the signal of a multihomed
   address and maintain all the routes.
   In the case of EVPN, the Ethernet Segment must also be the same. The flow
   for a successful multihomed registration is illustrated in
   <xref target = 'fRegmul'/>.
</t>
<t><xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces error Status values in the NA(EARO)
   which can be received synchronously upon an NS(EARO) or asynchronously.
   The Host needs to support both cases and refrain from using the address
   when the Status value indicates a rejection.

<section anchor='upd'><name>Enhancements to EVPN</name>
    <t>This section addresses the necessary changes to EVPN formats and behavior to support
        address registration security per <xref target='RFC8928'/> and mobility per <xref target='RFC8505'/>
        while retaining interoperability with traditional nodes.
        With 6LR injecting not only MACs via packet sources and TLLAO options but also ROVR into mobility
        extended community
        their semantics will be somewhat extended. Specifically following issues have to be addressed:</t>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The ROVR extends the semantics of the type-2 MAC advertisement via changes in MAC
            Mobility Extended Community in the sense that the MAC
            must be aligned with the ROVR and under normal circumstances
            only the validity of ROVR guarantees that the type-2
            MAC can be allocated to the requester. A MAC validated by ROVR should take precedence
            over MAC addresses allocated without using it given it presents a much more trustworthy
            topological information (it will be called ROVR MAC in further
            text). EVPN nodes not supporting extensions introduced by this document
            will need to be led to believe that a ROVR MAC is to be preferred over any advertisement
            they see as long a ROVR MAC route is present. Nevertheless, primary key of NRLI is still
            the IP/MAC/ESI combination as defined in <xref target='RFC7432'/>, Section 7.2 and 7.7.
            This implies
            that the same MAC (and consequently ROVR MAC) can be assigned multiple IP addresses and
            those represent independent NLRIs.
        </li>
        <li>
           The TID field in the EARO is smaller than the mobility sequence number in <xref target='RFC7432'/>.
           To allow a ROVR MAC mobility to "win" over legacy MACs in every circumstance,
            signaling must be introduced that enables to
           distinguish a TID-generated sequence number from a legacy sequence number.
        </li>
        <li>
           <xref target='RFC8505'/> supports IP multihoming, but does not differentiate multihoming from
            anycast, e.g., using the MAC address, to enable MAC address rotation. If an anycast IP address
            is registered with a different ROVR it will be rejected as duplicate. If it is
           registered with a different TID, the older sequence will be withdrawn. So the basic expectation
            with <xref target='RFC8505'/> is that
           the advertisement of an anycast address is coordinated, with the same keypair known to all parties,
            and the same value of the TID used by all nodes (and possibly never increasing), in other words,
            with no concept of mobility.
           This specification adds a flag in EVPN that signals that the IP address is anycast and requires
            the local 6LBR to ignore the duplication if the same IP address is registered locally, and then to
            inject the NLRI with the A flag set on mobility extended community as well.

        </li>
        <li>
           <xref target='RFC8928'/> needs the full ROVR to validate the address ownership,
            but the full ROVR can be too large to advertise through BGP.
           When an IP address is advertised through EVPN, it is REQUIRED that the EVPN Next Hop
            represents
            the address of the 6LBR of the leaf where the address was registered as well.
            This way, if the address is registered later on a second leaf,
            the 6LR in second leaf can leverage an out-of-band, i.e. via EVPN traffic carrying
            tunnels, EDAR/EDAC exchange
            with that 6LBR to validate that the ROVR in the registration is indeed the same.
            When that is the case, it can continue with the registration procedure and if
            successful, become a 6LBR for that IP address, either as a mobility event or as a
            multihomed registration.

        </li>
        <li>
           <xref target='RFC8928'/> expects nodes to autoconfigure the keypair that is
            used to form the ROVR, in which case the IPv6 address can be locally
            autoconfigured with no central coordination; in that case, the ROVR only
            protects the ownership and enforce first-come first-serve and source address
            validation. But it is also possible to pre-provision the ROVR in the 6LBR
            and then provision the keypair in the node, e.g., in the case of a trusted
            server. To enable that capability in EVPN, this specification adds a flag to
            signal that the 6LBR that injects the address in EVPN does not provide
            reachability to the address. When that flag is set, the value of the TID is
            ignored in the mobility computation, the mapping to the MAC address is ignored,
            and the route to the IP address is not injected in the RIB on ROVR nodes.
            Non-ROVR nodes will consider the node a "honey-pot". Once the address is
            registered by a 6LN in the network and the according validation with
            the node advertising the U-bit version of the route performed, the
            owner will inject the route without the U-bit. A node advertising the
            NLRI with U-bit in its mobility extended community MUST withdraw the U-bit route once it sees a validated
            NLRI without the U-bit and it MAY reinject the route with the U-bit once all routes without the U-bit are withdrawn to protect the address again.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <t>
        EVPN signaling is not used to carry ROVR since without challenge per  <xref target="RFC8928"/>
        they do not represent any difference over using the IP/MAC combination.
        Instead, the full ROVR is verified upon a movement or a multi-homed advertisement using an EDAR/EDAC exchange.

        Additionally,
        backwards compatibility could not be preserved given comparing routes based on ROVR would
        present a change in primary key of NLRIs which non-ROVR routers do not implement. An indication
        from a ROVR node that a MAC has been validated by proof of ownership is enough to convey the
        necessary information.
        Only a small hash of the ROVR is carried to speed up the identification of an address duplication.
    </t>

<section anchor='tgt'><name>ROVR MAC Mobility Extended Community</name>

    <t>
        Extending MAC Mobility Extended Community allows to design a solution that,
        while backwards compatible, allows to introduce ROVR MAC as "more trusted"
        entities. <xref target="feVPNtgt"/> presents the according extensions that
        will however necessitate some further explanation.
    </t>

    <t>
        To introduce a "precedence" of ROVR MACs over normal EVPN MACs ROVR MACs are advertised
        to look like "sticky" MACs for non-ROVR nodes.
        As defined in the glossary, for simplicity reasons such nodes will be called non-ROVR nodes vs. ROVR nodes.
        The "sticky" bit will force non-ROVR nodes to disregard the sequence number and
        accept any IP/MAC route provided.
    </t>

    <t>ROVR nodes MUST set the "R" flag in Mobility Extended Community to indicate that
    the advertisement is a ROVR MAC in case the host followed the according procedures.
        ROVR MACs use (instead of increasing the normal sequence
    number) the TID in the high bits of the sequence number field to "override" any normal MAC

            Multi-homing a MAC on mix of ROVR and non-ROVR nodes will lead to operational notifications since

<t>
   Following section illustrates several situations and resulting signaling
   in EVPN from the point of view of a ROVR node.
</t>
<t>
  <xref target='fReg1'/> illustrates the registration flow of a new address
  protected by <xref target='RFC8928'/>. The ROVR in the EARO is a Crypto-ID
  that derives from a public address through hashing with some other terms.
  The router challenges the host with a status of 5 (validation requested).
</t>
<t>
  The host performs the NS again, passing the parameters that enable to build
  the Crypto-ID in a Crypto-ID Parameters Option (CIPO), and signing that set
  of parameters together with a pair of Nonce values, one from each side, in a
  resulting Neighbor Discovery Protocol Signature Option (NDPDO). The 6LR first
  verifies that the Crypto-ID can be rebuilt based on the public key, then verifies that the signature in the NDPSO was effectively performed with the
  associated public key. When that is the case, the registration flow can
  continue, else the registration is rejected with a status of 10 (Validation
  Failed) in the NA(EARO).
</t>

<t>
  With this specification, the 6LBR communicates internally with the collocated
  eVPN router to inject the route in eVPN. Since the <xref target='RFC8928'/>
  validation was performed, the V flag is set. Once this is done, the local 6LBR
  installs a local state associated to the NCE and becomes owner of the
  registration, whereas the remote leaves optionally install a remote state for
  the address with the indication of the 6LBR that owns the registration. The
  local 6LBR MUST be signalled as EVPN Next Hop for the route.

  <xref target='fRegmul'/> presents the same flow but for a multihomed address;
  here and in the following flows, the proof of ownership section is not shown,
  but its use is RECOMMENDED. The interesting piece is that when the node
  registers to the second 6LBR, that second 6LBR find that there is a first
  6LBR that already own the registration. Using and EDAR / EDAC flow, the
  second 6LBR validates that the ROVR and TID are identical, in which case it
  accepts the registration and becomes another 6LBR owner of the registration.
  The result is that the 2 6LBRs are synchronized and any of the 2 can now be
  used, e.g., if the address is registered a third time.

  <xref target='fRegdup2'/> illustrates the case of an address duplication
  situation where by chance, the ROVR hashes are the same. In that case, the
  local 6LR checks with the 6LBR that owns the registration using an EDAR/EDAC message exchange. As opposed to the ROVR hash, the full ROVRs do not collide
  and the registration is also rejected.

        Address move differs from multi-homing by the ESI being different
        as visualized by <xref target="fRegmov"/>.
        In case of different ESI BGP signalling happens immediately, in
        case of multi-homing we can reasonably expect for the signalling
        to catch up on the other leg with a new, higher TID. However,
        since ESI matches TID doesn't matter strictly speaking and the
        new remote state can be installed as is. However, if 6LN is
        not refreshing it registration we can expect elapsed lifetime
        to create scenario
        <xref target="fRegTO"/> over time.

  e.g., if the address is removed fmor its own interface. This is done by
  registering with a lifetime if 0 as shown in <xref target='fRegArmov'/>.
  The Leaf may respond with a status of 0 to indicate success, but a status of 4 (removed) is preferred for this situation.

  The host that registered the address may withdraw the route but maintain the
  NCE, e.g., in the case where it is multihomed but does not want to use one
  interface for the traffic back as this time. This is done by
  registering with the R flag set to 0 as shown in <xref target='fRegRrmov'/>.
